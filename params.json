Some of them include:\r\n* Spotify [SDK](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-android-sdk/) and [Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/)\r\n* Firebase [Real-Time Database](https://firebase.google.com/) for quick updates to active playlists and users in the system\r\n* Volley HTTP [Request Library](https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html)\r\n\r\n## Design Patterns Used\r\nTo achieve high performance and a foundation of understandable code, popular design patterns were used in different components of the system. They are as follows (in the current build): \r\n* Singleton Pattern for the Spotify Profile Access and Playback functionality\r\n* Abstract Factory Pattern for creating collaborative playlists\r\n* Observer Pattern for notifying the playlist view when the database updates\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with In Rotation?
