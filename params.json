  "body": "# Welcome to In Rotation!\r\nThis is the next step in the music experience. The dangerous disputes over the aux cord... are over. With In Rotation, the music in the car or at the crazy party you're having will be a group effort, mixing the best and most vibin music for everyone. Sorry iOS, Android gets the front seat today. Simply download the application onto your Android phone, authenticate with [Spotify](http://www.spotify.com) and start spinning what's in your rotation.   \r\n![In Rotation Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-AndrewCofano/master/pages_resources/logo/record_logo2.png)\r\n\r\n## User Experience\r\nThe interface for In Rotation is simple and straightforward, helping you get hyped a little faster. The steps are easy and demonstrated below:\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<span>\r\n![Home Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-AndrewCofano/master/pages_resources/screenshots/HomeScreenScreenshot.png)\r\n</span>\r\n<span>\r\n![New Playlist Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-AndrewCofano/master/pages_resources/screenshots/SearchingSong.png)\r\n</span>\r\n<div>\r\n<span>\r\n![New Searched Song Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-AndrewCofano/master/pages_resources/screenshots/SearchedSong.png)\r\n</span>\r\n<span>\r\n![Active Playlist Screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-AndrewCofano/master/pages_resources/screenshots/ActivePlaylist1.png)\r\n</span>\r\n\r\n## Overview of the System Architecture\r\n### The System Architecture Overview\r\n![System Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-AndrewCofano/master/UML_Diagrams/InRotationMVP.png)\r\n\r\n### Class Diagram\r\nThis diagram demonstrates the relationship between a HostUser and the entire Playlist/Song structure\r\n![Class Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cpe305/fall2016-project-AndrewCofano/master/UML_Diagrams/InRotationClassDiagram-User.png)\r\n\r\n## Technologies\r\nExtending past the standard Android application, In Rotation was built on many current and powerful technologies. Some of them include:\r\n* Spotify [SDK](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-android-sdk/) and [Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/)\r\n* Firebase [Real-Time Database](https://firebase.google.com/) for quick updates to active playlists and users in the system\r\n* Volley HTTP [Request Library](https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html)\r\n\r\n## Design Patterns Used\r\nTo achieve high performance and a foundation of understandable code, popular design patterns were used in different components of the system. They are as follows (in the current build): \r\n* Singleton Pattern for the Spotify Profile Access and Playback functionality\r\n  \r\n    *Benefit:* Access to interact with music player and current playlist\r\n* Abstract Factory Pattern for creating collaborative playlists\r\n   \r\n    *Benefit:* Playlists can be made at runtime with filling up the database\r\n* Observer Pattern for notifying the playlist view when the database updates\r\n   \r\n    *Benefit:* The user does not have to refresh the playlist to get new songs\r\n\r\n## The One Thing I like best\r\nThe thing I like best about my design is that I kept the playlist implementation separate from Spotify's implementation. This allows me to have more control and customization of the playlist structure and offer the possibility of authenticating with different services (i.e. SoundCloud, Apple Music, Google Play Music).\r\n\r\n## Key Learning Experience\r\nThe key thing I learned throughout this project was that trying to develop understandable code is very difficult at first, but helps immensely when trying to implement more complex functionality and a more robust system. \r\n\r\nAnother key learning experience was learn the fact that when you are hours into an implementation of some functionality, it is almost always aguaranteed that you will think of a better/more efficient way to do it.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with In Rotation?
